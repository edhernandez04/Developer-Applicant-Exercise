What are your opinions on Agile software development?
    It is the most efficient approach. Also gives opportunity to clearly set plans and expectations.
    I like the fact that it stresses continual testing to assure quality.

TDD or BDD?
    I dont think its a matter of either or, an incorporation of both would be best for production level code. 
    Test Driven gives you a goal to aim for to establish a MVP. 
    Once established then a transition to Behavior in order to cover edge cases. The user will test the limits of the applicaiton so its best to try to cover as much as possible on the front end of the process.
