Hello Forrest!

I am a recent Flatiron School Bootcamp graduate and I am excited to continue my journey in software development! 
With a varied background within sales, management, and finance - I am confident that my skills and personality can deliver creative & pragmatic solutions daily.

There have been a lot of experiences that have shaped my career and who I am as a person. 
One of the most recent was at the end of the third quarter 2019, a group of us at Indeed decided to go celebrate. 
I was out with a few colleauges when a friend of mine could tell that I was a little off, so he semi-sarcastically asked “Ed, why aren't you buying shots for everyone?”

I wasn’t thrilled about sales anymore. All I could think about was building furniture, a hobby I picked up for the weekends. 
When I shared this situation with another friend on the development team at Indeed he recommended Software Engineering at Flatiron. 
I started practicing on codeacademy.com and I was instantly hooked. On the first night I completed the first 40 lessons in Ruby. 
The next day I applied to FlatIron and started the process.

I have taken my dedication, resilience, and hard working attitude into my coding journey. 
It has been amazing, I love building and developing ideas into fully functioning applications. 
Once I start it is hard to pull me away from projects. 
When working with someone like me, you will be partnering with someone who has the passion and focus to get things done & have a great time doing it.

This work makes me happy and I am extremely appreciative of your consideration. 
I look forward to discussing my short-term & long-term career goals and how they align with the goals of Hedgeye Risk Management, in an interview. 

Feel free to call or text anytime!

Thank you,
Ed
